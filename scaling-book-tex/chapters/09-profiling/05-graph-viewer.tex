\subsection{Graph Viewer}

While some of the fusions above can seem complicated, the XLA Graph Viewer makes them easier to parse. For example here's the view of a fairly complicated fusion:

\label{fig:graph-viewer}
\end{figure}

It's really helpful to stare at a bunch of HLO graphs and try to map HLO ops onto the code you're profiling. By hovering over a box you'll often see the line of code where the function was defined.
